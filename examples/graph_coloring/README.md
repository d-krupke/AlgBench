# Graph Coloring

This is a quick study of which graph coloring heuristic of NetworkX performs
best. It is meant as an example for AlgBench and the general structure of a good
study.

Graph coloring is an NP-hard problem that appears as subproblem in many
contexts. You can find more information on it on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring).

The documentation of NetworkX greedy heuristics for it can be found
[here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html#networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color).

## Overview

- [\_utils](./_utils) provides utils used during the study. In this case just a
  database for the graph instances.
- [00_generate_instances.py](./00_generate_instances.py) generates us a set of
  instances. In this case, I already ran the script. It generated the next file.
- `01_instances.zip` contains the graph instances generated by the previous
  script.
- [02_run_benchmark.py](./02_run_benchmark.py) runs a set of different
  algorithms on these instances.
  - [02b_run_benchmark_with_slurminade.py](./02b_run_benchmark_with_slurminade.py)
    just showing how to do the same distributed with
    [slurminade](https://github.com/d-krupke/slurminade).
- `03_benchmark_data` the data generated by the previous script.
- [04_check_results.ipynb](./04_check_results.ipynb) a simple notebook to check
  that the data looks fine.
- [05_process_results.py](./05_process_results.py) converting the data into a
  simple pandas table which is easier and faster to work with. In some cases,
  the raw data can also be too much for a Git, so you can only share the reduced
  file.
- `06_simplified_results.json.zip` the simplified pandas table generated by the
  previous script.
- [07_analyze_mean.ipynb](./07_analyze_mean.ipynb) a quick analyzis of the
  results. For real studies, you would have multiple such files following as
  there are often multiple aspects of the benchmark to evaluate.
- [08_analyze_runtime.ipynb](./08_analyze_runtime.ipynb) thus, we analyze the
  runtime in more detail here
- [09_analyze_quality.ipynb](./09_analyze_quality.ipynb) and the solution
  quality here
